Kim,

We applied the free license but kirk was unable to get it set up when i was on the phone with him last week.

I have also received word that the harddrives for your server should be in by Friday. Could we schedule installing those drive for Tuesday as well? This will need to be done once your closed as i will need to power the server down to add the drives.

thank you!

I also re-enabled a couple of basic policies and kept the rest disabled. I looked through the policies and they look fine. I did notice that the CA was issues by DC1 which is no longer in service but it doesnt expire for another couple of months.

I looked through the UniFi settings and dont see any issues there. I reached out to Will and updated him and asked to have them test again.

I am in the warehouse, not main office.
I “forgot” network on phone.
Under other networks,  I click BDE-Rad and it asks for username and pw
It does NOT let me in.
It still has a “locked” symbol, whereas BDE-Guest is open, with no lock symbol.

Thanks,

Good morning,

Kim, I have completely disabled the radius server on the BDE-RAD WiFi. Could you test connecting to that wireless network and let me know the following.

1. The wireless network no longer ask you for domain credentials

2. If it allows you to connect to the wireless network.

These are some troubleshooting steps I'm taking before i attempt to reset the radius server set up.

Thank you!

[Broadcom Inc Logo]

Dear Valued Customer,
Broadcom Inc., is modifying our authentication technology and will require you to activate your account after the transition is complete. Please note, no action is required at this time.
The change is planned for Jan 21, 2025. Closer to this transition date you will see additional instructions in the Broadcom Support Portal outlining the actions you will need to take.
Once the transition is complete, upon first login you will be required to:
1. Create a new password
2. Set up multi-factor authentication (if prompted)

Once the above is complete, you will be logged into the  Broadcom Support Portal where you will continue to have access to all your Broadcom Products & Services as before.
If you experience any issues after we have transitioned to the new technology:
1. Please first try and resolve your issue by using  Broadcom's Self Service Bot (i.e. password reset, MFA configuration, etc.).
2. Otherwise, please contact  Broadcom Customer Care.

Thank you,

Broadcom Support

We have ordered new office VOIP Phone system through Verizon. Please consider this the  intro email between Masters Telecom and PIM-ProActive our third Party IT team. I talked this over with Will some previously.  Not sure if there will be ports/IP addresses to manage, etc. But please put this on your radar that we will be changing our phones and might need some remote network support.

Here is the schedule:

Important Dates:
-          Installation – 1/7
-          Training – 1/8 or 1/9
-          Port – 1/10

A Verizon technician will come onsite 1/7 to setup the new phones. For just a few days, there will be both the old Fortinet phone AND the new Phone on your desk. Once the numbers have been ported over and we test out the system, we can remove the Fortinet Phones.

Once the conversion is complete, then we can talk about removing any Fortinet Phone system access to our system to close any possible lingering security issues from that system.

Thanks,

Kim Davis
Information and Technology Coordinator

Hello Proactive, 

I worked with Evan on 12/17 to have remote access to SAGE from my new company laptop.

Today is the first time I am trying to remotely use this computer and I am not able to again access to SAGE.

I have attached the ticket#41122 for your information.

Are you able to help me?

Thank you, 

Sue Bright

Please ADD VPN to Sue Bright's new Laptop.

Sue had VPN access on her previous laptop to remote into a computer in the office.

This is different. This laptop needs to remote through firewall so she can log into Sage and the “o” drive. To work as if she was here in the office.

Please contact Sue directly to work on this.

Thanks,

Kim Davis

We will be updating Tech Tools/Operix on our Sage Server. Marvin is used to doing this, so we’re not asking you to do the update. We want to apply this fix over the weekend, so please let us know today if possible.
But these are the recommended HW/RAM requirements for the update. Please verify that our server meets or exceeds the Highlighted requirements below, and  Please file this Information for our Sage/Tech Tools record

Please verify SageBrush Server Qualifications for Operix/Tech Tools:

A lightweight Operix Connector is installed on the Company's Sage 100 Contractor server for communication between the application and the Operix Data Center.
Supported Platforms
Operix must be installed on one of the following operating systems:

Windows 2012 Server R2
Windows 2016 Server
Windows 2019 Server
Windows 2022 Server

Software Requirements
The following software must be installed in order to use the SSO Connector

Microsoft .Net 4.8 or higher

Hardware Requirements
The server hosting the SSO Connector must meet certain minimum hardware requirements.
The following minimum requirements are only appropriate for testing the SSO Connector (non-production use):

16 GB RAM
10 GB of free disk space
SSD Storage is recommended

For production use, the server hosting the SSO Connector must exceed the minimum hardware requirements set forth below:

32 GB RAM
10 GB of free disk space
SSD Storage is recommended

Note: the above requirements are general in nature and actual system performance may vary due to multiple factors, including, without limitation, the number of users and database sizes.

If the allocated RAM isn’t enough, Can we add that to the Update Will is planning on Monday at 4:30?

Thanks,

Kim Davis

Angela, Will, PIM,

This does NOT work for us. Ninja needs to be set to Schedule updates/patches, not just pick some random day to update a computer with no notification. Please let me know what kind of resolution you can come up with.

Good morning ma'am,

Looking over the event log for Jessica's pc, it looks like a software patch was applied at 5pm yesterday that required a reboot. This patch was automatically applied after a routine scan from NinjaOne. We do not receive notification of these scans.

Any planned updates that we do after hours, we send an email to alert you beforehand.

Thank you

Evan Nelson

We need to know your schedule for updates and/or some notification about updates.
At least 2 scenarios:

1.      Many of our Sage users depend on using the printer, but some don’t have Admin rights. Whatever update ran overnight on Jessica’s laptop  messed with Sage’s ability to connect with printer. So she could not use Sage until an Admin could sign in to allow the Printers to reconnect
2.      Several people leave their desktop on and purposefully leave windows open to be ready to start the morning with those items left open. Today, all those items were gone (Jessica)

So please let me know what night you are doing regular updates?
And if you are doing a special update, we need to know.

Thanks,

Kim Davis

Subject: My work Laptop

A few questions here. So, Will (from PIM) is somewhere in my laptop still added in as a user I believe. Is it supposed to be that way?
Next question…. The updates they do. They used to ask permission so you could save your work and so on… But I caught one yesterday when I came in and today my system did a whole reboot because they must have pushed something. So, any documents I had open, notes I had places unsaved or projects that were left open are gone. Shouldn’t we be warned of this? OR they need to ask?

Kim, didn’t you want to know what they were pushing?

I feel like they get into things when they want, with out requesting. I of course was using a few things as my memory, since I was bombarded with people right before close of business, and now its all gone do to a forced shut down by someone else!? Ugh……

Heads up

 Took a minute to figure out where the issue was > realized the DC was handing out DHCP
 Went to the firewall and enable DHCP for the LAN that had been previously created
 Was able to get internet again
 Got back into the host and powered on the DC, SAGEBRUSH and SYNC
 Confirmed the DHCP services were running again on the DC
 Disabled DHCP from the FW and confirmed I still had a connection
 Confirmed PCs are back online in the Office

Kim,

below is the user information. Please let me know when you are ready to log into the AD account so i can run a sync. I need to run the sync after he changes his AD password so it reflects in Microsoft. Last time we were trying to update both password which causes issues and conflicts with each other. Please give me a call before you start setting him up.

Will, evidently  Matt Dugas was accessing Erik Sherwood’s email account – as a point of reference for Sales information and deals Erik had worked on while Erik was an employee.

Do you have a way to restore Erik’s email account in a way that Matt Dugas can have access?

Thanks,

Will, our Verizon MDM tokens need to be renewed. By end of day Monday or Tuesday. I asked Verizon to help but have not heard back from them. Do you have time to work with me on Monday to do this together? I have the instructions but don't want to mess it up.

If you can help, I can request a ticket.

 I tested sending both emails and did not receive bounce backs
 I confirmed the messages were flowing through Sophos and O365 filters
 There was a Microsoft outage today 11/25/24 that caused issues with users being able to use functions of O365 applications including outlook emailing and calendar functions
 I replied to crystal with Kim and Cory CCd about the outage and attached the O365 email regarding the outage.
 I also let her know I tested sending Kim and Cory an email and did not receive bounce backs and see mail flowing through filter
 Will call Kim in the morning to discuss",,,,,Time Entries:,Member,Date,Agreement,Bill,Work Type,Work Role,Actual Hrs,,,,,,,,Total Services: 156

***Urgent,

For Erik Sherwood – esherwood@bankdesign.net
Please log him out of all sessions, stop him from logging in again. Please deny him any access to anything BDE digital.
Please redirect his email to Cory Conner –cconner@bankdesign.net

Please disconnect the Microsoft License from his email address. We don’t want to “lose” that license. We will assign it to someone else later.
Whatever files he has on OneDrive, if any, we will want access to – but not let him have access.

This is an employee sudden termination. Please take appropriate action.

Thanks,

Kim Davis

Good morning,

Kim, I see in the ticket you put this is an “email only user.” I spoke with Brandon on the set up and this is why he did not create an AD account. I have asked him to go in and create an AD account for the user.

Did the user need an AD account?

Thank you!

The other groups (allemployee, install, Offsite Users - Restricted Access) that Jay is a part of will need a Windows user account in order to join them.

I got Jerry added. Is Lee receiving duplicate emails?

Thanks,

Notes
 Added Jmorris
 Only saw lmanchester once in AD
 Did some research
 It stated they may appear twice but there should not be any issues as long as they are not getting duplicate emails
 Seeing if Kim can verify if Lee is getting duplicates

Thanks – and for Will - please look at one more thing:

Can/Should a person be both “Domain” user and “Offsite User – restricted access?”

I can’t remember if “Domain” user is something “everyone” has to be a member of?

I do know that “Offsite User – restricted access” is supposed to mean the user does NOT have access to our in-house servers. And both of these users most definitely are supposed to be “offsite users – restricted access.”

Thanks,

Please update only Brett Devier and Jonathan Bobbey:
They both need to be on multiple email distributions groups.
These groups are in our Active Directory and MS 365 – need to sync.

1.     Brett Devier email distribution groups to be the same as BOTH Jeff Stires (service) and Jeff Micklege (Sales). Brett does both Sales and Service – so he needs to be on the email distribution groups for both.
2.     Jonathan Bobbey email distribution groups  to be the same as Jeff Micklege (sales)

Brett Devier is getting a popup message that his Microsoft 365 Account will be deactivated at the end of this month. (in 8 days)
That’s shouldn’t be happening.  Please work with Brett to make sure his computer is connected to the right MS365 account, etc. so that he doesn’t lose access to his files, his email, etc.

Brett’s contact information is below. Even though Brett has an auto reply about being out of the office – please call him anyway.

(remember, he’s the one that lost access to his email account earlier)

Thanks,

Kim Davis

Kim,
Any updates on the deactivation of my 365 account? End of the month is drawing near and I cannot afford to have no access to Word and Excel.

Will,

As I think on this some more. In the end, my issue was resolved when we updated my phone credentials trying to login to the WIFI with an old password. I have not asked Jessica to check her phone and wifi login in formation.

She’s using the brand new laptop – so it’s hard to imagine she has saved local creds causing failed logins. It’s brand new.

Will,

Appreciate how you jumped in there with Jessica today and worked on the issues with Sage.
I’m not trying to be pessimistic here, but I believe what you did today (except the email part) was already done before.

So, just to be prepared for the morning.  Some things I think we might need to be more curious about:

For the most part, Jessica works fine after she finally gets logged into Sage. So….
What happens overnight with our system, concerning automated processes?
What’s part of the regular routine of our behind the scenes intranet world that stops and restarts her logins, her profiles, her firewalls, her permissions, her VPN, her anything?

Do you see where I’m going with this? What is happening between when she leaves work in the evening and then comes back in the morning?

And What is happening between 7:15 am and 8:00-8:30 am when after repeated attempts she can suddenly  login again to Sage? Or when she can go to my computer and login to the computer and Sage, then go back to her computer and she can then login?

Maybe this week she’ll be fine for more than one day in a row. We’ll see.

 They updated the SQL profile to match most of the settings already set up in the Windows Authentication profile

I am using my cell phone. I do not have access to your portal. It says I need to be a Microsoft administrator so I’m sending it to this email because this is the email that I can find in my phone. Here’s a photo of my issue trying to remote in from home at this time.  

When I click on Sofos to remote in, it says 968-533 100 no Internet access please wait.

I was on Jessica's pc as soon as she logged in and we got the error message when she tried to access Sage immediately. I did a screen shot of the error message so we now have something work with to get to the bottom of it.  We reboot her pc to try again, when she logged in, verified she was connected to the bank design share drives, then we tried Sage again and it worked.  Having the exact error message gives us something to work with, I am going to get with someone on our staff is is a good SQL person and get this corrected.  I will keep everyone posted, have a great day!

Thanks,
Joanna Peterson

Notes
 Got on Jessica's pc and got the SQL error she gets when it doesn't work
 Reboot her pc and made sure she was connected to the O:\ drive
 Sage worked at that point
 I grabbed the error message so we can get to the bottom of what is happening.

Jessica, no need to apologize at all!  I know how frustrating things can be.  PIM can put in that admin access as well. Give me a call in the morning when you are ready and I'll see if we can get to the bottom of things.  Have a great rest of your day!

Good afternoon Joanna,

First I would like to apologize. When I sent my email out it was meant to be internal. I know we have a portal and a phone # to call after hours… but I am unaware of any specifics as in what hours PIM functions for example (After hours). Since Kim met with you all, read all the information regarding your company, and is working out of the office today. I sent detailed info to her to make her aware. In regard to the Admin alert. I had also emailed her because she use to be the admin for Microsoft. Is that PIM now as well? The screen shot below is actually what I am getting when I try to utilize your portal. So I had asked if we have a company log in or do I need to be granted access to report an issue to your company through your portal?? Also I should be here around 7:30AM tomorrow morning.

Hope this is helpful.

Thank you,

-          Jessica

Jessica, I am the after hours on call person this week. If you will call as soon as you get in, that way I can remote to your pc at the very beginning and try to catch the exact error when it happens.  The times I remote to your pc, I have missed the screen where it asks you for admin privileges.  Let me know what time you might get to the office tomorrow and I will be available, thanks!

We will look into this, I do see her screen shot but each time I have been in, I've not seen the request for admin privileges. I will reach out to Jessica and ask her to call in first thing when she gets in and maybe I can catch it when it asks for admin privileges.  Thanks!

Thanks,

 Kim needs us to look further into Sage issue with Jessica

I got a call from Jessica this morning, and when I remote to her pc, it connected correctly.  I didn't realize they were Microsoft errors popping up; the error I saw was she couldn't connect to the Sage server.  This happened once before, as soon as I remote to her pc, it works.  Does a Microsoft error pop up while she is using Sage?

Thanks,
Joanna Peterson

Really need to resolve Jessica's issue with Sage. Except for Active Directory which is used to login to Sage, syncing with Azure, Microsoft shouldn't be popping up when logging into Sage. Please escalate this.

Subject: RE: Sage Issue

Do we have a company account/login? Or do you need to grant me access? They want us to call… tired of calling every morning/sometimes their no even there yet to answer the call (including the afterhours line) or use the portal that we can’t get in lol.

FYI Kim,
Since that guy was here Thursday, I have to call every morning to get into Sage, so I’m not getting to start on ticket and things like that till close to 8. Joanna has been kind but is unsure of why this is happening. Once she remotes into my computer it lets us into Sage. Like its just my access not connecting to the server. (I personally believe it has to do with remoting in, and the issue is I’m not, BUT I’m not IT J).

Thank you in advance! And Heads Up!

PIM prefers tickets to be called in or via portal.
You can also email a ticket in to helpdesk@proactive-info.com

Please burn, x out, trash the email Support@proactive-info.com – there is no support, only help.

Kim,

Didn’t they just tell you last week to email it in to a different email?
This fell says they haven’t done it that way since 2021!? They are interesting folks.

Hello Jessica,

As of May 4th, 2021, this email no longer serves to put in a help desk support ticket with PIM. Emails to this account are not monitored. We suggest that you put in a ticket via the client portal so that your service is not delayed.

You may also contact the PIM help desk for onsite and remote service Monday-Friday, 8:00 am – 5:00 pm via (804) 897-8347.  For After Hours support, you may call (804) 897-8347 and select Option 2.

Again, thank you for your continued patronage of PIM.  We look forward to helping you with your issue once your ticket is received through the proper channels.

Good morning, I wanted to follow back up on this and make sure everything is working with Brett's email again. From what I can see on this end, it is back up and running. I also asked Microsoft Support if they had any information about why this happened all of a sudden, but all they saw was that there was that the mail user was hung in a soft delete state without an indication of why.

Thank you,
Ray Fulk

Notes
 I haven't heard back from the client yet, so I logged back into 365 and made sure Brett's mailbox is still in place, and ran a message trace to confirm he's been sending and receiving emails since 10/10. I will follow up with Kim again since she should be back in the office now.
 I had also asked Microsoft Support if they had any information about why this happened all of a sudden, but they weren't able to provide any. Based on the information AppRiver provided on excluding the msExchMailboxGuid attribute, I believe that this shouldn't happen again.

I haven't heard from Microsoft yet, but from checking Microsoft 365 directly, I see the conflicting mail user is gone and that Brett's mailbox has been restored. I wanted to follow up and see if everything is working again.

I'm afraid the problem at this point is that a Mail Contact using Brett's email address in Microsoft 365 was erroneously created via the synchronization between your local domain and Microsoft 365, and that contact object is interfering with his mailbox in 365. Even when we removed him from the AD sync the other day (which temporarily deleted his 365 account and restored it), we still couldn't remove this Mail Contact on our end. Ultimately, only Microsoft can go into their servers and manually delete this item, since we keep getting an error when attempting to delete it on our end. From working with AppRiver support, I've already made changes that should prevent this from happening in the future.

Ray, at this point, it would have been faster to create a new account, transfer his files to it. Delete the old account. Wait 48 hours . Recreate his account. And then move everything back. Unless Microsoft had a mandatory 30 day wait. 

It's been over a week here, we need something better than waiting on a third party.

Closed By: Cari Grafton",Discussion:,"10/08/2024 8:28 AM UTC-04/ Ray Fulk -   Hunter, the level 2 technician assigned to the case, responded with the following:
""Based on the steps taken so far, the conflicting MailUser Contact appears to be from a separate synced object on your Domain Controller. The errors when attempting deletion from the Cloud indicates is on-prem Synced object, not a Cloud Managed object. This most commonly indicates that there is another object in your DC with the needed Proxy address that has the GUID of 4ea019c3-e7ef-4087-86b2-e29451db89de , and that will need to be removed from syncing in you DC to remove it from the cloud as well. We are only able to manage and directly support the Cloud side of O365 and not the Domain Controller or the on-prem side of AD/Entra Sync. I would suggest searching your OUs for any other objects referencing that GUID as it is likely the cause syncing this to O365 and blocking the User Object from using that proxy address.
""
 I logged into BDE-DC2 and tried using the following Powershell cmdlets on the local domain controller to search for objects with the GUID Hunter mentioned, but they do not turn up anything:

get-aduser -filter { ObjectGUID -eq ""4ea019c3-e7ef-4087-86b2-e29451db89de"" }
get-adobject -Filter { ObjectGUID -eq ""4ea019c3-e7ef-4087-86b2-e29451db89de"" }

To double-check, I also ran the following cmdlet to write a list of all AD objects and their GUIDs to a text file, then searched that file for the GUID he provided and failed to find anything:

 get-adobject -filter  | ft Name,ObjectGuid | Out-File GUIDs.txt

In the same vein, I tried exporting a list of all AD objects and their mail/proxyAddresses properties. According to that list, only the bdevier user object has the address bdevier@bankdesign.net associated with it:

get-adobject -filter  -properties Mail,ProxyAddresses | fl Name,Mail,ProxyAddresses | Out-File mail.txt

For reference, here are the results of get-aduser bdevier -Properties proxyAddresses,mail:

Good morning, AppRiver support asked me to temporarily exclude Brett's domain account from syncing to Microsoft 365, in order to try and resolve this email issue. I tried that, but it didn't seem to help. It looks like it may have recreated his 365 account in the process, so please let me know if I need to restore anything from the backup for this account.

Thank you,
Ray Fulk

Notes
AppRiver asked me to move Brett's local AD account to a non-syncing OU and run a sync, to try and remove the mail user that way. I did that and confirmed that it removed his 365 account, but it did not remove the mail user, and still prevented me from manually deleting it as wall. I put the local user account back and ran another sync, and confirmed it recreated his account. AppRiver also mentioned that they thought that the Tenant Service Principal account may still be included in conditional access, so I checked those policies and confirmed it was still excluded. I followed up with AppRiver to let them know, and will follow up with the customer as well in case there is something I need to restore from the backup due to this account being recreated.

I went in and began exporting a copy of Brett's OneDrive as well, just in case. That is larger than his mailbox, so it may not complete today. I will check on the status of it later this afternoon.

Closed By: Cari Grafton",Discussion:,"10/04/2024 10:24 AM UTC-04/ Ray Fulk -   I don't see where the re-sync recreated Brett's mailbox, even after over an hour. I logged into AppRiver to check the archive and backups. I confirmed that Brett does have a mailbox backup up to 9/30, which coincides with the error starting on 10/1. The article AppRiver support provided also mentioned the possibility of them deleting, purging, and recreating the account. In case they intend to do that, I began exporting a copy of everything from the 9/30 backup, in order to download that onto BDE-SYNC. Deleting and recreating the 365 account shouldn't impact the cloud backup, but I would rather not take any chances.
 While I waited, I reviewed the Synchronization Service Manager in order to get a better idea of what happened. It looks like a sync job on 10/1 at 7:53:34 am updated Brett's account, but I don't see exactly what changes were made. I checked the audit logs in 365, but didn't see anything there to indicate what happened either.
 The export completed, so I saved that to ""C:\Users\proactive\Downloads\bdevier_bankdesign.net_Exchange_20240930231607_0.zip"" on BDE-SYNC.",,,,,Time Entries:,Member,Date,Agreement,Bill,Work Type,Work Role,Actual Hrs,,,,,,,,Total Services: 156

I have finished applying the changes that AppRiver recommended, and it could take up to an hour before they take effect, so I will check back up on this later this morning.

Thank you,
Ray Fulk

Notes
AppRiver sent the following KB article, suggesting that AD Sync may be what is creating the MailUser object instead of the mailbox: https://support.zixcorp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1655/track/AvOEwQpRDv8S~SIrGkoe~yL3dusqeC75Mv8G~zj~PP~P. I reviewed option 2 of removing the local msExchMailboxGuid attribute. I went into Active Directory on BDE-SYNC and to make a note of that attribute on Brett's account (E8 0D E4 23 32 70 3F 48 9D 94 E2 32 39 20 0A F7), then cleared it and started an AD Sync job. That completed, but it could take up to an hour for the mailbox to provision, so I will need to check on this later.

I've reached back out to AppRiver to ask for a status update. Once they've identified and solved the problem behind the scenes, we should then have a better idea of what happened with Brett's mailbox, since nothing changed on this end.

Thanks for the update. But it’s been 4 more hours. Anymore progress on this?

What I don’t understand  is why now? And why Just Brett? What happened overnight Sunday or Monday that changed Brett’s email? Herb Wilson, Tom Bright, Lee Manchester, Jeff Micklege, and Huck Early all have 365 and email what’s different about their accounts?

I investigated this further and confirmed that the issue is within Microsoft 365; Brett is listed as both a User and a Contact, and the Contact entry is what his email address is tied to. I get an error when I try to remove the Contact, so I've updated the AppRiver support ticket. I also called AppRiver to get another technician to look into this, since the current one only responds at night. AppRiver's back-end team is investigating the error on their end now and will let me know what they determine.

Thank you,
Ray Fulk

Notes
 AppRiver responded last night and said that they believe the issue is with the local AD. I already checked that, but I decided to look over it once more. I used Powershell to confirm that the only object in the local AD with this email address is Brett's user account. I then logged into the Exchange Online Powershell using the following guide: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/troubleshoot/email-alias/proxy-address-being-used. From checking the objects there, I determined that there is both a User object for bdevier, and a MailUser object for that same address. The latter is a tenant-wide Contact:

 I tried to remove that since Brett is also a user and will need this address for his mailbox, but it didn't work. I tried removing it via Powershell, but got the following:

 This error is on Microsoft's end, and I don't see anything I can do to resolve it. I checked to see if I could set up a temporary mail flow rule for messages sent to bdevier@bankdesign.net and redirect them to bdevier@bankdesign.onmicrosoft.com. However, it looks like the User bdevier's mailbox doesn't exist due to this conflict. I emailed the AppRiver technician back in order to update the ticket, then called AppRiver directly to see if another technician can look at this since the current one only seems to be available after hours. The technician I spoke to looped in the back-end team to see what is going on. They did some digging for a while with me on the line, and are going to continue looking into this. They will update the ticket with what they find.

Closed By: Cari Grafton",Discussion:,"10/01/2024 10:10 AM UTC-04/ Dalton Boothe -  Kim,

Just wanted to update you here. It looks like Brett's SMTP address may be assigned to another user as well. We were unable to locate the other account. I am going to escalate this ticket to see if we can take a deeper dive into this.

Thanks,
Dalton Boothe

Notes
 Began looking into the issue
 Checked O365
 Found the user's account was active and licensed
 Saw the following message

 Searched Identity, AD, and Exchange admin
 Nothing found
 Joey and I looked through the Sync jobs to see if there were any errors
 Nothing stood out
 Using Powershell to connect to Exchange online and attempt to locate the account using the SMTP address
 Nothing found
 Will ask Ray for assistance

Unknown To address

How to Fix It
The address may be misspelled or may not exist. Try one or more of the following:
 Send the message again following these steps: In Outlook, open this non-delivery report (NDR) and choose Send Again from the Report ribbon. In Outlook on the web, select this NDR, then select the link ""To send this message again, click here."" Then delete and retype the entire recipient address. If prompted with an Auto-Complete List suggestion don't select it. After typing the complete address, click Send.
 Contact the recipient (by phone, for example) to check that the address exists and is correct.
 The recipient may have set up email forwarding to an incorrect address. Ask them to check that any forwarding they've set up is working correctly.
 Clear the recipient Auto-Complete List in Outlook or Outlook on the web by following the steps in this article: Fix email delivery issues for error code 5.1.10 in Office 365, and then send the message again. Retype the entire recipient address before selecting Send.
If the problem continues, forward this message to your email admin. If you're an email admin, refer to the More Info for Email Admins section below.
Was this helpful?  Send feedback to Microsoft.

More Info for Email Admins
Status code: 550 5.1.10

This error occurs because the sender sent a message to an email address hosted by Office 365 but the address is incorrect or doesn't exist at the destination domain. The error is reported by the recipient domain's email server, but most often it must be fixed by the person who sent the message. If the steps in the How to Fix It section above don't fix the problem, and you're the email admin for the recipient, try one or more of the following:
The email address exists and is correct - Confirm that the recipient address exists, is correct, and is accepting messages.
Synchronize your directories - If you have a hybrid environment and are using directory synchronization make sure the recipient's email address is synced correctly in both Office 365 and in your on-premises directory.
Errant forwarding rule - Check for forwarding rules that aren't behaving as expected. Forwarding can be set up by an admin via mail flow rules or mailbox forwarding address settings, or by the recipient via the Inbox Rules feature.
Recipient has a valid license - Make sure the recipient has an Office 365 license assigned to them. The recipient's email admin can use the Office 365 admin center to assign a license (Users > Active Users > select the recipient > Assigned License > Edit).
Mail flow settings and MX records are not correct - Misconfigured mail flow or MX record settings can cause this error. Check your Office 365 mail flow settings to make sure your domain and any mail flow connectors are set up correctly. Also, work with your domain registrar to make sure the MX records for your domain are configured correctly.

Subject: pdf blaster

Hi,
I would like to download pdf blaster so I can email our monthly billing easier and faster.  I found this website www.pdfblaster.com and at the bottom it shows a “Download Now” link but when I clicked on it nothing happens. Here is some additional information about pdf blaster www.pcmethods.com/pdfblaster This page says the vendor went of business so it’s impossible to buy new copies of the software. Do you know if there is something similar?

 Wants to use a PDF blaster to send invoices to customers instead of printing and mailing invoices
 the link PDF blaster Carrie sent is no longer in business
 I reached out to SAGE support and ask if they could provide a recommendation
 SAGE recommends using ""PAYA"" for this they sent me some information
 I read through information on the products (this looks like what Carrie needs. Invoicing and electronic payments)
 To be sure i send Paya a request to set up a call to discuss the product
 Emailed Carrie with information on the product and will let her know once i get a call set up with Paya so she can join

 Did some research on SAGE and Microsoft 2FA > apparently outlook is not able to send emails due to 2FA in the version of SAGE we are currently on. and outlook does not allow you to create an APP Password to attach to an outlook account
 I tested using one of the gmail account BDE currently has (created an app password in GMAIL . enter app password in sage configuration)
 Confirmed i can successfully send emails with the gmail account
 Call Jessica to reconfigure the sage email client
 We created a new gmail account titled ""BDEticketnotification@gmail.com"" set up 2FA going to Kim and set up an app password
 Entered this information into the SAGE email client and tested
 confirmed we are able to send emails from sage again and its coming over from the BDeticketnotification email we created
 Call Kim to explain what i had to do and set up 2FA to go to her phone
 email Kim the gmail account information and app password
 Had call with sage support they confirmed my suspicions of 2FA issues and stated outlook work in the new version 26.2 we are currently on 25.3

Good morning Joanna,

I am in… sorry I do not get right back to you, once in… I am trying to make up for lost time.
I appreciate your time. Kim is aware and has my laptop in hand.. she will reach out if needed.

Thank you again,

So questions about today:
Are you working ok and was the resolution addressed or just you trying again until you got on?
When will Kim return to look at your new laptop and would it be helpful to have one of us either on site or scheduled to be available on the phone?
I truly want to help you!

Thanks,

I am not on the new laptop yet. I had told Will that I didn’t have time to get set up on Monday and he worked on it some while here anyway. So I left it to the side for Kim to review once she returned this week. I have added her to this email.

I am in the office on my desktop currently trying to catch up.

Good morning,

I can’t even log into my desktop. This has been happening since last week. My problems become worse and worse, every week there’s something new. There’s no reason I need to call your company every day so I can start my workday. No one else in this office has too. This is ridiculous. I have yet to hear what the issue is who’s worked on it and who’s supposed to be in charge of fixing it. It has been going on since before 7-24-24. This is over three months. I personally feel our company is owed some reimbursement for the money, business, and time lost… not to mention stress. But this is not my company so if needed, it can be disputed elsewhere.

Please create new user and Microsoft Account for

Jonathan Bobbey
Email: jbobbey@bankdesign.net
Remote Sales Team – does not have access to Office Servers, but does have company laptop.
Needs full Microsoft Account including Teams

I don’t have a profile that exactly matches Mr. Bobbey’s situation. He is sales – so Microsoft Office and Email distribution groups would be like Jeff Mickelege, Brett Devier, and Erik Sherwood – But this is a company laptop, and not a Mac.

Please use Basic Setup for Laptop – It has already been delivered to your office.
Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Good morning,
I am working from home today partially, due to an appointment. I’m unable to get in through Sophos. my laptop did updates this morning and it’s telling me my authentication has failed. Please assist. You can call me on my work cell. 540-471-1504. I was told the laptop I still have at home should work fine. I want Kim when she returns to look at the laptop that was just set up because she had specifics she had requested. I wanna make sure it’s the way that she wants so we don’t continue to have these issues hopefully .

thank you

Before when I clicked on the outlook button it would pop up a box for me to select email addresses and name the attachment, click ok and it pops up in my email, click send and it goes to my sent folder.  Now when I do that it just pops up in my email without letting me select email addresses for it to send to and without letting me name the attachment (which should be the invoice #).  So, I can still email invoices from Sage but I have to pull up their client record to see who I am supposed to email invoices to…just takes more time.

I hear the 2 laptops have arrived at your office.

Please give me a call so we can talk about the setup and licenses.
Because of the Issues Jessica is having with her current computer setup, we don’t want to just copy her setup onto the new laptop. We want to take advantage of the newness, and not transfer 10 years of computer baggage onto the new machine.

It should be more like what was done for Fred. But, she still needs to be able to work on her existing setup until the laptop can be onsite. I trust you have a plan for this transition.

1.     She will be replacing her desktop with the new laptop. So when she remotes in from home, she won’t be remoting into an onsite computer. Once we switch her to the new laptop she will only have the one device – to use at work or at home.
2.     Her current desktop has a non-subscription version of MS Office. She will need to change her current ‘email only MS license’ to the Full MS office subscription – like Tom and LEE and the Sales team has.
3.     She’ll need Sage installed.
4.     She’ll need her browser information copied over, and her desktop shortcuts moved over.
5.     I don’t know if her files are on re-direct, or if her Files will need to be copied over.
6.     Will need to verify that she can work remotely from home.
7.     Other things…?

Those are the kinds of things we need to talk through and work out for Jessica’s laptop.

I ran a message trace on Cory's emails being sent to Clyde and I see the ones sent today state that they were delivered. It could be that they are being sent to a Spam or Junk folder on Clyde's side. Is Cory able to receive emails from Clyde without issue?





Thanks,
Brandon Walcott

Notes
 Navigated to administrative center of O365
 Ran a message trace on Cory's emails to Clyde
 Saw that Cory had sent emails out to Clyde today and all of them state they were delivered successfully
 Will email Kim to let her know the results

Cory Conner has sent several emails to Clyde Baileyclyde.bailey@bcbonline.com  over the last few months. Most with attachments, but at least one reply without an attachment.
Clyde Bailey has not received those emails and Cory has not received any kickback notifications about a message failing to send.

Can you check if Cory’s emails to Clyde Bailey have left our system? And if that’s the case, does that mean that Cory’s emails are being blocked on Clyde Bailey’s side?
Are you able to check if Cory’s email is on some cyber-space blacklist?
Lastly, is there a way for Cory (or any of us) to know if our emails are not being received? (aside from calling the person we sent the email to)

Thanks,

Kim Davis

Subject: New Laptops

I hear the 2 laptops have arrived at your office.

Please give me a call so we can talk about the setup and licenses.
Because of the Issues Jessica is having with her current computer setup, we don’t want to just copy her setup onto the new laptop. We want to take advantage of the newness, and not transfer 10 years of computer baggage onto the new machine.

It should be more like what was done for Fred. But, she still needs to be able to work on her existing setup until the laptop can be onsite. I trust you have a plan for this transition.

1.     She will be replacing her desktop with the new laptop. So when she remotes in from home, she won’t be remoting into an onsite computer. Once we switch her to the new laptop she will only have the one device – to use at work or at home.
2.     Her current desktop has a non-subscription version of MS Office. She will need to change her current ‘email only MS license’ to the Full MS office subscription – like Tom and LEE and the Sales team has.
3.     She’ll need Sage installed.
4.     She’ll need her browser information copied over, and her desktop shortcuts moved over.
5.     I don’t know if her files are on re-direct, or if her Files will need to be copied over.
6.     Will need to verify that she can work remotely from home.
7.     Other things…?

Those are the kinds of things we need to talk through and work out for Jessica’s laptop.

Brandon, Jessica is off today, so I am using her computer to continue the trouble shooting.

Her computer system name is WS-REC-SPR.
 
Sophos is on her computer, but I don’t see it in Ninja.
 
Please call me. Today is a good day to work on this since Jessica is not Using the Computer, and my login is not working on it either.  Mobile Phone: 540-471-2852
 
Please feel free to remote into the computer and test things out. Call my cell phone if you need me to do something.",,,,,Time Entries:,Member,Date,Agreement,Bill,Work Type,Work Role,Actual Hrs,,,,,,,,Total Services: 156

So yesterday afternoon, I still had a decent amount to do. I was kicked off of my computer it said somebody had remote in, prior to that at some point it popped up and wanted to let Kim remote in around 11 o’clock. I was very busy corresponding with customers so I declined. I had no idea what it was about and figured I’d say something in case it wasn’t Kim. This morning. I turn on my laptop and it says you’re almost done setting up your PC like it’s been set back to factory or something. Now it’s asking me to sign in with a Microsoft account, this is not Kims fault.

I’m asking PIM what is so different with my computers/laptop/system - that this seems to primarily be happening to me. Day after day. I am the front line of communication for our company so this is definitely affecting business, our customers, and my stress level.

Sage has not called me back yet.L Just a heads up.

I could get in from home prior (thought about that as a 2nd half of the day fix), but I’m assuming something likely has changed to where maybe I can’t now, if we reloaded Sage?

I’m concerned… to our customers it’s like we are closed.

Brandon – on Tuesday we put Jessica’s computer on it’s own Ethernet line.
Meaning before – the internet cable went from wall plug to phone then to computer.
Now there are 2 internet cables – one for the phone and a different one to a different wall plug for the computer.

Jessica has been working remotely these last 2 days – so we do NOT have any good information concerning if that change has been helpful or not. Jessica plans to be back in the office on Friday and next week.

Will you also be working on correcting the Windows Certificate Errors that are often coincidentally occurring on the same computers that have connectivity issues?

Thanks,

Joanna, this has really been dragging on for a long time.
Is there not a way to look at logs on this? So when Jessica gets kicked out of Sage she can mark the day and time, she logs back in and keeps working and then you can look through the logs and see what was happening around that time frame on her computer.

Yesterday – she had the Windows Certificate Error. I installed the certificate on her computer.  Do you guys need to update our Email Certificates so we don’t keep? We are also getting Certificate Errors on our Wifi, can you all fix that too?

Subject: RE: Ticket#39344/BDE001/Sage not working for her -- has been updated

Good morning,

I’ll reach out when it happens again, however I want to say Thursday, Friday, and Monday. Sage kicked me out completely without any warning or error code. I was working on an email went to click back on my Sage window and it was gone.

Toward the end of last week we found a temporary work around (still unable to do my work in full w/ that even) because I don’t have time to call in every time this happens. There is no one else to do my work or handle all incoming from customers while having these issues.

Added Kim to the email.

Thank you for looking into this,

Good morning,

I’ll reach out when it happens again, however I want to say Thursday, Friday, and Monday. Sage kicked me out completely without any warning or error code. I was working on an email went to click back on my Sage window and it was gone.

Toward the end of last week we found a temporary work around (still unable to do my work in full w/ that even) because I don’t have time to call in every time this happens. There is no one else to do my work or handle all incoming from customers while having these issues.

Added Kim to the email.

Thank you for looking into this,

Good morning, I enlisted Brandon on our team to look at the Sage server issue.  We looked at the logs and see you in today.  So we can catch it in the act, next time it fails, call the service line so we can look at the server and your system at the same time.  Thanks Jessica!

Thanks,
Joanna Peterson

No warning this time. I’m busy, I was creating an email, went to make a ticket and realized all of a sudden Sage was completely closed.

Hi Kim, the ticket is not closed.  I just had two of them going for the exact same thing so I had to bundle them together.  I got on to her system this morning and grabbed the error messages.  We did reboot her system, made sure she was connected to the share drives, and then she was on.  I am working with someone who has better SQL knowledge, as that's where the error is coming from.

Thanks,
Joanna Peterson

This issue has not been resolved. So is the ticket really closed? I’m thinking that was a mistake…

Everyday when Jessica comes to work in the morning, she can’t log into Sage. We start at 7:30, and you start at 8:00. So that’s a lot of work time being lost – especially since Jessica and Sage is the driving force for our Service Ticketing system and our Service technicians need their tickets so they can start heading down the road early in the morning.

I just want you to understand that Jessica having access to Sage at 7:30 am is considered a critical system to our company’s ability to function.

So yesterday afternoon, I still had a decent amount to do. I was kicked off of my computer it said somebody had remote in, prior to that at some point it popped up and wanted to let Kim remote in around 11 o’clock. I was very busy corresponding with customers so I declined. I had no idea what it was about and figured I’d say something in case it wasn’t Kim. This morning. I turn on my laptop and it says you’re almost done setting up your PC like it’s been set back to factory or something. Now it’s asking me to sign in with a Microsoft account, this is not Kims fault.

I’m asking PIM what is so different with my computers/laptop/system - that this seems to primarily be happening to me. Day after day. I am the front line of communication for our company so this is definitely affecting business, our customers, and my stress level.

""This email is regarding case ID: 01785436 where reported issue is: Devices Failing to Obtain DHCP from Firewall

From the logs till now, its not enough to determine where the problem is.
As a next plan -

we require  MAC based captures on Firewall with the device we are checking

    Conntrack and droppackets will help us confirm if we are dropping any traffic and to check conntrack entries for the particular MAC.
    Commands are -

Open SSH of the firewall(Via putty)-

Press 5 (Device management ) > press 3 (Advance shell)

# drppkt | grep 00:50:56:b0:c1:ad

# tcpdump -i Port1 ether host 0c:8d:ca:56:1f:2c

# conntrack -E | grep <MAC>


    If DHCP requests from any system is routed to firewall and not dropped anywhere in between we should also be able to see it in DHCPD logs

Thank you!""

Dennis had also mentioned taking a switch onsite and using that to test with the affected workstations, so I may need to follow up with him on that.",,,,,Time Entries:,Member,Date,Agreement,Bill,Work Type,Work Role,Actual Hrs,,,,,,,,Total Services: 156

Closed By: William McCauley",Discussion:,"08/15/2024 11:32 AM UTC-04/ Ray Fulk -   I went in and cut the DHCP back over, and Dennis is going to try and reproduce the error by rebooting the computers that seem to consistently fail. So far he can't reproduce it, so I installed Wireshark on Kim's computers (DESKTOP-2SLFM1E & DESKTOP-TIQE2020), and Jerry's (OFFICE0441).
 Dennis was able to reproduce the error on Kim's computer DESKTOP-2SLFM1E, so I worked with him to run a packet capture. It looks like it sends a large number of DHCP requests, and after a few minutes eventually gets a DHCP ACK from the firewall, but even when it does, it doesn't accept the IP for some reason and continues to request an IP. Dennis suggested rebooting the firewall, but that didn't help, and BDE-SYNC went down. I took the opportunity to remote into that and start Wireshark there as well. I saw the same behavior there, so I SSHed into the firewall and started a packet capture via tcpdump so that I could export that: https://community.sophos.com/sophos-xg-firewall/f/recommended-reads/114837/sophos-firewall-how-to-tcpdump. I also restarted the capture on BDE-SYNC. Dennis had to leave in a few minutes, so I ran an ipconfig release and renew to reproduce the error in the packet captures, then stopped and saved those. I switched them back to the DHCP on DC2, and Dennis confirmed everyone is able to reconnect. I exported the packet capture from the firewall and reviewed it in Wireshark on my PC next to the one from BDE-SYNC.
 I followed up with Sophos support to let them know the status, and uploaded the PCAP files to the ticket.",,,,,Time Entries:,Member,Date,Agreement,Bill,Work Type,Work Role,Actual Hrs,,,,,,,,Total Services: 156

Closed By: William McCauley",Discussion:,"08/07/2024 4:19 PM UTC-04/ Ray Fulk -   I logged into BDE-SYNC and downloaded the installer for Wireshark, as I wanted to have that handy just in case there are DHCP issues on that server. I then logged into BDE-DC2 and pulled up the Ubiquiti dashboard so that I can disable DHCP snooping. I pulled up the firewall from Sophos Central and enabled conflict detection in the DHCP config. Once everything was ready, I called Kim to make sure I could get started on this.
 Once I received confirmation, I stopped the DHCP Server service, disabled DHCP snooping in Ubiquiti, then enabled DHCP in the firewall again. I manually released and renewed the IP on BDE-SYNC and confirmed that it obtained an IP address again.
 Kim also mentioned that Joanna was going to get with me about a few other services to restart at this time. I asked Joanna about that, and there are a few services on SAGEBRUSH that need restarting to resolve a logon issue. I went in and restarted the SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) and SQL Server (SAGE100CON) services.
 I called Kim back and asked her to reboot her computer to see if it will obtain DHCP. It looks like it did according to the firewall. Also, she tested out Sage and confirmed she could log into that.
 I'll keep an eye on the DHCP leases this evening to make sure other devices obtain DHCP.",,,,,Time Entries:,Member,Date,Agreement,Bill,Work Type,Work Role,Actual Hrs,,,,,,,,Total Services: 156

I have switched back to DC2 as the DHCP server, and confirmed that a number of computers (FEDEX, BDEInventory, and BDE-202206L002) immediately came back online. I also checked BDE-SYNC and manually renewed the lease there to ensure it successfully obtained an IP from DC2. I will continue to monitor to make sure the other workstations renew properly, and will also open a ticket with Sophos support to see if they can offer any suggestions as to why certain workstations failed to obtain IP addresses.

Thank you,
Ray Fulk

Notes
I disabled DHCP on the firewall and started the DHCP Server service back up on BDE-DC2. I confirmed that the FEDEX, BDEInventory, and BDE-202206L002 computers immediately pulled IP addresses and came back online. I went into BDE-SYNC and forced it to renew its address to make sure it correctly obtained one from DC2. I will continue to monitor to make sure that as devices' existing leases expire, they will continue to renew on DC2.

Sure, you can switch back – If you need to restart servers, let me know and we can schedule for 4:30 pm.

Just a few thoughts:

The change was on Wednesday – on Thursday only Cory and I had troubles. On Friday as far as I know it worked fine for everyone. Monday was 4 people. Today was 3 of those 4 people.

over the last 10 years – our system/Our users/Active Directory  - has been managed by BTMI (now defunct)/genius internal secretive IT person (before my time)/ EN Computers, and now you all. Each had their own way of managing IT problems – and each computer/laptop and each user has been setup and changed who knows how many times – some hard coded somewhere on the device, some in Active Directory, some in Windows, some in some special place. – so there may not be one solution for everyone. But the 3 devices with the problem today are all our newer Computers – and Fred’s computer is barely a week old.

Still problems this morning with DHCP Assignment:
Overall – need a solution to this problem with Jerry, Fred and Cory.
Bill Clements does not return to the office until next week, so I don’t know where he Is on the issue.

All 3 on Windows 11:
Fred Baars – new laptop, Jerry Morris – new (bought in 2024) desktop, Cory Conner newish laptop.
fbaars@bankdesign.net; jmorris@bankdesign.net;  cconner@bankdesign.net.

Carrie Turner – cvturner@bankdesign.net – Windows 10 Desktop, did not have trouble with DHCP today, but did yesterday. Today seems like a different issue – can’t access a specific banking website that previously had access.

Cory Fixes his problem by accessing BDE-RAD wifi, gaining a connection there and then plugging back in the Ethernet cable.

The others require assigning static ip with a Local admin account and then switching it back to DHCP.

Since we don’t know the local admin account name and pw, this makes it difficult to resolve on our own. Our guys typically start working around 7:00 am and at the latest 7:30, which is not your typical business hours. Which makes it hard to fix too.

Good morning, I am reaching out about this ticket as it seems like workstations are continuing to run into problems obtaining IP addresses after they have been shut down. I don't see enough evidence to determine why this is happening, as it doesn't look like the Windows Firewall on the workstations is blocking the traffic. At this point, I believe it would be best to switch back to the DHCP server on your domain controller until I can get a better understanding of what the error is.

Thank you,
Ray Fulk

Notes
 I took a closer look at the Windows Firewall configuration on BDE-SYNC to see if DHCP traffic was being filtered outbound. It looks like it is set to allow DHCP traffic to any server, regardless of whether it is on a domain, private, or public network, which is the expected behavior. Once I identified the rule for this traffic, I was able to use the following command to view it via the command line:
netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name=""Core Networking - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP-Out)""
 I used the remote shell function in Control to check this same firewall rule on a number of PCs that have been having trouble connecting to DHCP, and confirmed that none of them are set to block DHCP traffic.
 At this point, it isn't clear why these devices are failing to obtain DHCP after they've been powered off for a few hours. Since this appears to be a persistent issue, I think it may be best to switch back to the domain controller for now for DHCP.

Closed By: William McCauley",Discussion:,"07/29/2024 8:27 AM UTC-04/ Ray Fulk -   I briefly checked the firewall logs, as I noticed that a few devices that were pingable on the LAN were not checking in with Automate. It looks like those devices were not communicating out to the internet via the BDE-LAN-to-WAN rule, but rather were hitting the ""Outbound Rule"" rule beneath it and failing due to heartbeat status. I changed the minimum source heartbeat from green to yellow to match the BDE-LAN-to-WAN rule, and then confirmed that those devices started coming online.
 It looks like Joanna and Will are working on tickets about two devices unable to connect this morning, so I followed up with them as well to let them know that briefly setting a static up and then reenabling DHCP seems to work. Will tried that with his user and that worked. Joanna said she spoke with Carrie, and Kim is going to work with her.",,,,,Time Entries:,Member,Date,Agreement,Bill,Work Type,Work Role,Actual Hrs,,,,,,,,Total Services: 156

While the workstations appeared to be fine (compared to a list of online workstations gathered Friday afternoon), the server BDE-SYNC said it was offline again. I logged into that via vSphere, and found it was not pulling DHCP. I disabled Windows Firewall and then disabled/reenabled the NIC, but it still didn't work. I checked the firewall and confirmed that the DHCP service was still running there and that other clients were pulling IP addresses. I reset winsock and rebooted, but it didn't help. I then manually set a static IP and confirmed it then connected to the bankdesign1.local domain. I put it back on DHCP and confirmed that it pulled its reserved IP successfully.
 I started a packet capture on the firewall for DHCP traffic, and tried releasing/renewing the IP on BDE-SYNC. I saw in the packet capture that there was an ACL violation, though the DHCP renewal did go through, so I looked into that. It turns out that is a false positive according to Sophos: https://support.sophos.com/support/s/article/KB-000039048?language=en_US.

This is the same computer we successfully tested yesterday. One other user ran into this issue when they connected to the wired network, but the issue went away when connecting to the wifi.
 I had Kim try disconnecting and reconnecting the network cable, but that didn't work. I asked her to reboot, which also didn't work. I walked her through pulling up the network settings, and they appear to be for the BDE network, though we didn't see the IP address. I had Kim disable and reenable the NIC, though it still says that this is an unidentified network. Kim mentioned that this computer connects through a small switch, so I asked her to reboot that as well.
 That still didn't work, so I walked her through setting a static IP address. Once she did that, I was able to get in. I tried checking the Event Log, but the System log wouldn't pull up. This seemed similar to the Windows Firewall issue I worked on the other day (#38879), so I disabled the Windows Firewall on her computer and then tried reenabling DHCP. It connected correctly after that, and I was able to reenable the Windows Firewall afterwards. We rebooted again to make sure it would still connect on a fresh boot, and it did. Kim will let us know if there are any other issues, but so far everyone else is working fine.",,,,,Time Entries:,Member,Date,Agreement,Bill,Work Type,Work Role,Actual Hrs,,,,,,,,Total Services: 156

 I then logged into the firewall and input the DHCP configuration, but didn't save/activate it yet. I called Kim at 4:30 and confirmed I was going to start making the changes. I pushed the changes through on the firewall, then stopped and disabled the DHCP Server service on BDE-DC2. I called Kim back and let her know, and asked if there was a workstation I could test on. She said I could connect to her computer DESKTOP-2SLFM1E. I logged in and manually released and renewed the IP address, and confirmed it registered with the DHCP server on the firewall and that my ScreenConnect session came back up momentarily. I ran ""ipconfig /all"" to confirm the DHCP server is the firewall.
 I logged into BDE-SYNC and manually released/renewed the IP addresses there to make sure it pulled the correct reserved address. SAGEBRUSH has a static IP, so I didn't change anything there. I used Automate to renew the IPs for BDE-20133 and BDEINVENTORY in order to test out a few more devices. I also saw that the FEDEX client automatically renewed its lease.
 Since the timeout for these leases is three hours, I will check again at 8pm tonight to ensure that all of the other online devices pick up new leases from the firewall. I made a note of the devices that are currently online in Automate.",,,,,Time Entries:,Member,Date,Agreement,Bill,Work Type,Work Role,Actual Hrs,,,,,,,,Total Services: 156

If you would prefer to wait until the backup project is complete, that should be fine as well, or I could do it Wednesday afternoon. I plan on disabling the DHCP service on the domain controller, so that if necessary we can start it back up if DHCP fails to work on the firewall. I plan on setting static IP addresses on the servers, but if the printers fail to obtain IP addresses from DHCP on the firewall, that would interfere with printing until we get that fixed.

Thank you,

I was really wondering about whether it was wise to wait until the backups were done before we make this kind of change. Our system is notorious for things that should be simple end up crashing other unexpected things. Will you make this “easily reversible”, so if  we run into problems you can just flip it back?

We can do this Monday @ 4:30 - BUT
I won’t be in the office Tuesday morning if there are problems when people start logging in and trying to work – so you all would need to be ready.

Or We could do this Wednesday @ 4:30.

Will the copiers/printers still be working? Any problems connecting to Sage or the “O” Drive? Any problems with ability to remote in?

For us, if the change is not expected to take long. We close at 4:30 pmand I can ask everyone to log off at that time. So then we you could possibly finish your part and we could test a few devices before 5:00 pm – on any day of the week – wouldn’t want to do it on a Friday.

Good afternoon, Javon had asked me to take a look into what it would take to move your DHCP services off of your domain controller and over to your firewall. It looks straightforward, so I would like to schedule a time after hours to change that over. Please let me know a time and date that works best for you.

Thank you,

From what I see, it looks fairly standard: they have a pool of addresses from 192.168.0.19-100, a few exclusions from that pool, and 10 devices with static assignments. The lease timeout is 3 hours. I double checked the firewall and confirmed that I can replicate these settings there. I will reach out to get additional details about scheduling this.",,,,,Time Entries:,Member,Date,Agreement,Bill,Work Type,Work Role,Actual Hrs,,,,,,,,Total Services: 156

Due to offboarding our tools I am unable to verify that the uninstall has completed. When you get a chance, could you please check the device and let me know if Sophos successfully uninstalled. If it did then we can take care of the rest of the tools on the backend to have it fully offboarded.

Thanks,
Brandon Walcott

Notes
 Called Kim
 Confirmed that she wanted our tools offboarded from the BLUERIDGETUNNEL device
 Logged into Sophos
 Found the device
 Disabled Tamper Protection
 Remoted into the device
 Began uninstalling Sophos
 Connection to device dropped
 Will email Kim asking to verify Sophos successfully uninstalled
 If so, then I will Retire the device from Automate, Disable the computer in the AD, and remove it from Sophos

 Jessica is unable to remote into her office PC from her home device
 Attempted to remote into her device, but MASON-DIXON was under the Retired devices
 Restored the device, but will have to wait to be able to remote in through Automate
 Used the remote support link to remote in instead
 Jessica attempted to remote in with RDP session saved on Desktop
 Gave the following error:
 Remote Desktop can't connect to the remote computer for one of these reasons:
1) Remote access to the server is not enabled
2) The remote computer is turned off
3) The remote computer is not available on the network
 Tried remoting into the PC with Automate
 Remoted in successfully, but saw another profile was already logged on
 Signed the other user out and had Jessica try again
 Same error occurred
 Checked her VPN
 VPN was disconnected
 Reconnected the VPN
 Jessica tried remoting in, but stated she did not have permissions to remote into the computer
 Logged into the computer and added her as an allowed user
 Jessica successfully remoted in
 Asked Jessica if it was the right computer
 She stated that everything did not look the same as when she usually logs in
 Tried a different computer that had jaites as the last logged in user
 Jessica remoted into that computer successfully and stated that this was her correct office pc
 Changed the IP address saved on the RDP Session from 192.168.0.54 to 192.168.0.29

In our Legacy Email Account system, On Monday morning,

Please replace David MoneyPenny’s email account –dmoneypenny@bankdesign.net
With an email account for Chris Sargent –csargent@bankdesign.net
As of Monday Morning, Moneypenny will no longer need an email account with us, but Chris will.

Please give Chris the same permissions, groups, etc. as David Moneypenny.
Please place in same Active Directory Folders, etc. as David Moneypenny.
Please make sure the email address can send and receive emails internal and external.

Billing-wise, this should be a swap on our old email account that was through EN, not a new email address billed on your email system.  Whoever is working on this, please talk with Angela or Will or myself – if you don’t understand this. We have pre-paid a certain number of licenses through the end of the year on the old system and don’t want to be double billed.

I finished checking on EASTSIDE340, and I don't see any evidence that this SMB connection is anything malicious. File and Printer sharing is enabled on the computer, and I believe that is causing this computer to periodically reach out to the only server on the network it knows of (the DC, since it is a DNS server). However, since this isn't on the domain, it tries to connect using the local computer credentials.

Thank you,
Ray Fulk

Notes
 I worked with Kim to get reconnected to EASTSIDE340, then reviewed the SMBClient event logs, but they did not indicate what process is initiating the SMB connection. I ran Wireshark again, and found that the process ID is 65279, though I don't see that listed in Task Manager. From research, it looks like that is the default PID for SMB traffic. I ran Process Explorer using the following guide to filter for SMB events: https://xkln.net/blog/determining-which-process-is-making-smb-requests-on-windows/. That didn't catch anything, so I filtered for just PID 65279, but that also didn't find anything. I tried filtering just the IRP_MJ_CREATE operation, and it still didn't show any processes when Wireshark indicates a connection is trying to be established.
 I did some further digging on this device, and saw that File and Printer sharing was enabled in Windows Firewall and on the NIC. I believe that sends out periodic SMB packets to other devices on the LAN, and since the only device this the DC (as a DNS server), that is why it is trying to establish a connection.

Good afternoon, I wanted to follow up and see if we could take a few minutes for me to remote back into EASTSIDE340 to take another look at the SMB logon requests it keeps sending. If so, you should be able to go to https://pim.hostedrmm.com:8040/ on that computer and enter code 73726. I believe Dennis bookmarked that URL in the default browser when we were logged in the other day.

I don't see that computer in Automate or Sophos, so I wasn't able to check on it further, but I wanted to reach out to you about it to determine if we need to install our tools on this computer and if you would like to start a remote session on that computer for me to check on the failed logon alerts.

I reviewed his logs and didnt see anything suspicious. After a remote session and unlocking his account I had him try again and it said his password was incorrect. I had him type it but not enter it so I could see what he was inputting.

Viewing his password I noticed he was entering it wrong as this happen last week as well. He keeps putting a 01 at the end and I remember that its a year date. Once I pointed that out it clicked and he remembered and was able to enter the right password.

Seems 3 failed login attempts locked him out due to his incorrect password. ",,,,,Time Entries:,Member,Date,Agreement,Bill,Work Type,Work Role,Actual Hrs,,,,,,,,Total Services: 156

We found that the AD check box, ""User cannot change password"" was preventing it from working but once unchecked it worked fine. We verified it immediately updated there Windows login as well as long as they where in the office and there workstation was communicating with the AD server.

I drafted up a email template to send to users to walk them through the password change. Kim sent me a list of users. I sent the email to the user.

I reviewed his logs and didnt see anything suspicious. After a remote session and unlocking his account I had him try again and it said his password was incorrect. I had him type it but not enter it so I could see what he was inputting.

Viewing his password I noticed he was entering it wrong as this happen last week as well. He keeps putting a 01 at the end and I remember that its a year date. Once I pointed that out it clicked and he remembered and was able to enter the right password.

Seems 3 failed login attempts locked him out due to his incorrect password. ",Time Entries:,Member,Date,Agreement,Bill,Work Type,Work Role,Actual Hrs,,,,,,,,Total Services: 156

 ask Jeff some questions > PC is personal Mac book that is not connected to the domain
 in order to connect to the BDE -RAD WiFi network the PC needs to be on the domain as it authenticates through a radius server
 Jeff said we can put his PC on the domain
 I sent Jeff a remote link > had issues controlling his PC at first had to find the setting to allow remote control access
 Tried connecting to the domain > realized he was still on the hotspot
 Had Jeff connect to BDE-Guest > unable to connect to the domain > guest network does not talk with the production > confirmed i could not ping the DC from the guest network
 We need to hardwire his PC > his MAC does not have an Ethernet port and he does not have an adapter to connect his PC
 sent Jeff an Ethernet adapter from Amazon > Jeff will order piece and get back with me to connect his PC to the domain",,,,,Time Entries:,Member,Date,Agreement,Bill,Work Type,Work Role,Actual Hrs,,,,,,,,Total Services: 156

Please add Kirk Fox kfox@bankdesign.net to the monitoring@bankdesign.net email group.
I looked in Active Directory and couldn’t add him there because monitoring is a “user” and not a “distribution group”.

So please add Kirk where-ever he’s supposed to be added so he can also receive emails when an email is sent to monitoring@bankdesign.net

Thanks,

Please stop forwarding email onJmicklege@bankdesign.net to cconner@bankdesign.net
Please disable jmicklege out of office message too.
He is back in the saddle again and needs to be able to send and receive email on his own.

Jeff has been trying to send emails, some are being received, some are not.
One example is sending email tomroby@bankofclarke.com it looks like it’s sent  - no errors on his side.
Her IT people have confirmed email is not being blocked. It’s left his sent box, but not gotten into the inbox.

Thanks,

Aside from all the DHCP issues, does Sage seem to be working today more consistently?  Ray restarted those services yesterday.  I will leave this open until tomorrow.

Right now Seems to be just Jessica. She is back in Sage, but that’s not the whole point. Evidently this has been happening off and on all week. Need to check on the part of the popup that says things like – not a trusted domain, doesn’t work with integrated authentication. And she’s already logged in and working and then it kicks her out.

Hi Kim, I'm glad she is back in.  Since this is an ongoing issue, why don't I get on your server after hours, stop and start the necessary services.  Let me know if I can do this, maybe after 7:00 tonight?

Thanks,
Joanna Peterson

Jessica is back in but Kim says ongoing issue

Hi Kim, as far as Jessica and Sagebrush, is it just her? Has she logged out and back in/reset her pc?  I can stop and start the Saebrush service, that will be a short blip for all users, so let's make sure she has tried these other steps?

Thanks,

Hi Lee, I'm working on your ticket for your email questions, I saw the email thread with Kim, are you still having issues?  If so, let me know a good time I could remote to your desktop and see what's going on.  Thank you, have a good day.

Dalton, Jerry logs in only when he needs to ship a package and then it goes to save screen really quickly. Please contact Jerry directly to set a time for him to log in and you to remote in.

Dalton, we have a current problem. In the current Fedex Ship Manager, he can only retrieve 1 month of data. Can you restore the database? He need to be able to go back at least 4-5 months – usually he has access to all history.

Can you check the Zebra printer and see if it has an ethernet port? Zebra support stated if it does not, then it is USB only.

Thanks,
Dalton Boothe

Notes
 Spoke with Zebra support
 The Z500 is typically only USB
 Seeing if Kim can check if it has an ethernet port

So this product key they gave is good for 3 days, after that I would just need to request a new one. We can set it in Ship Manager, but it will still be set on the individual computer. So unless the Zebra is a network printer, they may not be able to print to it.

A Little confused about the 3 day product key? You have 3 days to use it or it will self-destruct after 3 days and we need to buy one?

And then the label printer… we’re not going to use the ship manager to determine the label printer? So each person will have to find and select the correct printer everytime they print a label and then what does that mean for their everyday printing? I really want to safeguard that we don’t end up printing regular things to the label printer.

The printers will be set up on a computer to computer basis, and the FedEx device should continue to work after the product is entered into the new installation. The product key is good for 3 days.

We have 2 printers that print labels, one is currently connected to the “Fedex” computer. I think the other is connected to Kirk’s computer or is currently offline. They are both the same kind of Printer.

I remoted in to the Fedex computer-  the label printer is the Zebra ZP500 (ZPL)

The report printer is currently set to an HP LaserJet 1020 –b ut I don’t think that’s connected anymore.

We would want the label to always be the Zebra printer, but the Report printer, we would want to be able to choose, depending on who created the label. The Report printer absolutely cannot be the Zebra printer – otherwise the reports will be printed onto labels.

I spoke with FedEx, they stated that the installed software on the server is incorrect. The ""server"" version that is installed is for very large shippers who make their own front end software that points back to the server, typically 2 or 3 connected failover servers. They verified using the account number that you all use the ""Software"" rather than ""server"" version. Did you want me to move forward with them to get the correct version installed on the server?

Thanks,
Dalton Boothe

 Spoke with FedEx
 They stated we have the wrong software

I'm not sure about if one will stop the other from working. Since this is going to be on the server, we may need to set up RDP shortcuts for the users. As for the printers, I am not sure what that process looks like yet, right now I'm still just trying to make sure that the software on the server works, but I will be taking a look tomorrow to see about that after trying to transfer data from the desktop.

Thanks,

OK Dalton, lets think about this. If I’m right, we can’t have both the Local Shipping Manager running and the Server based one, right?

So we’ll need Jerry and Kirk’s computer to have an shortcut icon on their desktop to access it.

And will you need to do anything to the printers so that the server based app can connect and print the labels?

I’m not onsite – so to get everything connected and running, do we need to wait for the reboot till tomorrow when I’m onsite?

Or has what you started already made the local shipping manager not working? I’m just trying to keep continuity of ability to create shipping labels.

Call me if we need to talk this out.

Please make a note that the Restart  Function on this computer does NOT work.  Must do a full shutdown and then manually restart. AT this time we do NOT want time spent on fixing that problem – will most likely decommission this computer after Fedex APP is successfully moved to the server.

Here’s what I have – some of it may have nothing to do with the Fedex Manager App

Fedex Ship Manager – App we currently use for shipping – stand alone one computer version. Located on the “Fedex” computer.
Account # 0296607 in the app.
Jerry Morris – jmorris@bankdesign.net – is the person most likely to be the Fedex Point of Contact. He has had a recent death in the family and is not available at the moment.
Cory Conner  - cconner@bankdesign.net – may also be listed with Fedex as a contact person.

Need to download the Fedex Server version. Load onto one of our Virtual Servers (not SageBrush). Import info from the Stand Alone version into the Server Version. Connect with the Fedex Label printer(s). Then Give permissions for Jerry Morris, Kirk Fox, Marvin Henderson, Sue Bright, Kim Davis to use the App and the printer(s).
Possible phone support (but might be for Freight Acct):

I will try to get that information to you this week.

Timeframe is as soon as you have the information you need.
You will need to pull current Fedex data from the “Fedex Machine” so our addresses autopopulate.

If moving forward with the install, remote into FEDEX and share out the Zebra printer. Reach out to FedEx support (1.877.339.2774) and use the account info in this ticket to get a product key. Proceed with install on the DC. Then roll out the network clients as well.",,,Time Entries:,Member,Date,Agreement,Bill,Work Type,Work Role,Actual Hrs,,,,,,,,Total Services: 156

However, the web server's replies are being blocked by the firewall as invalid traffic, and it is not clear as to why. I checked to see if it does this to other HTTPS traffic, and confirmed it does, but those connections still go through. I checked the reports and noticed that websites classified as Information Technology are being blocked, including msedge.net, which might be part of the problem. Will is on the phone with Sophos now, so I updated him in Teams.",,,,,Time Entries:,Member,Date,Agreement,Bill,Work Type,Work Role,Actual Hrs,,,,,,,,Total Services: 156

Good morning.  We can reach the site internally and also from  the browser on BDE-DC2.  Are the users still having issues with this site?  Possibly they need to flush their browser cache (Shift + F5 in the browser).  Let us know the status, have a good day!

Thanks,

Notes
 Site can be accessed remotely and from BDE-DC2.

Hi Kim, I was able to create the out of office status message with no problem.  What the Office365 portal will NOT let me do is forward his emails to multiple mailboxes.  I can only set it to forward to one mailbox and I used cconner@bankdesign.net.

Hi Kim, I have set the Out of Office for Jeff Micklege to go to  cconner@bankdesign.net.  The Office 365 admin portal only lets me forward to one mailbox so I used Cory as he was the first on the list.  Unless Jeff has already gone with his laptop, here are some instructions for setting up rules in Outlook for multiple mailboxes to be set as forwarded mailboxes.

To forward to multiple email addresses, you can ask this user to set up a rule in Outlook to forward to the addresses. For more info, check out Turn on automatic forwarding in Outlook. For Outlook on the web, see Use rules to automatically forward messages.

Cory Conner is also having issues connecting VPN
 Had her show me the process she is doing
 Connecting VPN correctly but missing a step, After connecting to the Sophos VPN client she needed to open the RDP shortcut titled ""Office PC""
 we went through the process start to finish. Connect the Sophos VPN client and then open the RDP shortcut
 She is using a company laptop that is not connected to the domain and was trying to only connect the VPN client which will not work as the PC is part of ""WORKGROUP""
 Kim understand process now. I am sending her some instructions on how to connect the VPN client and RDP session should she or others need it for reference
 Cory stated he was able to connect, he was his VPN client now as he was doing some incorrect steps. Confirmed Cory is able to connect to the VPN
 issues resolved

I re-structured there Automate sites to conform with our new policy. I merged the server site with the main. Re-named the main site to there actual location, Waynesboro. I created a new site with there location Waynesboro (No Sophos) and moved the two workstations that could not have Sophos there. I setup auto-deploy for there main site. I also created a Remote/Mobile Device site and moved the system I was working on today there as I know its not in the office as well as a few others I determined to be Remote based on IP address.

Closed By: Andrew Blais",Discussion:,"07/22/2024 8:15 AM UTC-04/ Ray Fulk -   I logged into BDE-DC2 and checked the VM host. It looks like all three VMs are online, but BDE-SYNC and SAGEBRUSH cannot ping out to the internet. I can ping the firewall from both VMs, but when I try to run a traceroute out to the internet, it doesn't even get as far as the firewall. I confirmed I can ping BDE-DC2 from the VMs, but noticed I can't ping these two servers from BDE-DC2. I checked the Windows Firewall settings, and noticed that BDE-DC2 and SAGEBRUSH say they are not on domain networks. I disabled and reenabled Windows Firewall on BDE-SYNC, and that allowed it to get back out to the internet. However, doing the same on SAGEBRUSH didn't work. I logged into BDE-SYNC and accessed the VM host from there, then briefly disabled and reenabled the NIC on BDE-DC2, which allowed it to reconnect and list itself as a domain network. I did the same for SAGEBRUSH, and it appears to be online now.
 It looks like these three servers rebooted at 1am yesterday, though the VM host itself did not reboot.
 I called Kim and confirmed that she was able to log into Tech Tools again and access everything. We discussed what happened, and it looks like these servers rebooted to apply Windows Updates during the scheduled patch window. She would like to discuss changing the patch window so that patches don't run over the weekend. I let Angela know.

Good morning I am investigating why these servers are down, possibly a switch issue?  The dom.ain controller is up and I am able to login.  Can you give me a call at 804-601-0907 , I'm looking at the switch also

Thanks,

Dalton, we tracked down the “missing” AP and Kirk has connected it to network so you can update it. No need to wait to update that unit as it’s just sitting in the Warehouse IT room and not “installed” anywhere.

Kirk sent this:  D021F9dd2171 is mac address of one that’s open box.

Sometime someone decided to use the Ethernet Cable for a Camera and took down that AP. So the AP is in the IT Closet. But it would be nice to get it updated and we can put it up somewhere when we decide to run a cable and use it again.

Thanks!

It appears that you are already listed under the admins for the UniFi controller.

Thanks for the reminder about the switches.
The AP updates can be done during working hours. Our office hours end at 4:30 so the switches should be done  between  4:35 and 5:00 – but let me know the date, so I can warn anyone wanting to work late about the possible interruption.

If it is convenient for you all to handle the firmware update at the same time as the DHCP move to the firewall at the same time, that is fine with me – unless you don’t want to do those on the same day.

I appreciate you checking on that, I will have to check to see about credentials for the UniFi controller, as for the updates, this will cause WiFi disruptions, and the switch updates may cause network interruptions as well. If you are still okay with this during regular working hours, please let me know a good time and I will push the updates.

I will check on the Warehouse AP.
It’s ok to update the firmware on the AP’s during regular office hours.
Do you have a login method for me to see the Wifi dashboard, so I can know more what/how many total you show active and their names, etc.?

Good afternoon! It appears that the devices are good to go, except for 1 (BDE New Main Warehouse AP). They are behind on firmware updates, I will look at my schedule to see about what day afterhours I can get that done. As for the New Main Warehouse AP, do you know where this AP is and if it is active?

Thanks,
Dalton Boothe

Notes
 Spoke with Andrew
 Checked UniFi Network
 It appeared they were all online but 1 (BDE New Main Warehouse)
 All were behind on updates
 Andrew recommended finding the one that is offline (will need to be onsite)
 Need to schedule time to update firmware as well

If possible, we would like for Brett Devier – bdevier@bankdesign.net to remove the restrictions from his laptop against blocking Alcohol and Tobacco websites.

He is a remote user who does NOT VPN into our Server and does not connect his laptop to our internal network.

Are you able to change the website blocking policies for one user? Or can you set up a group policy for this and he’s the only one in it?

If you can make the policy change for him, he is remote, so how will you update the policy on his laptop? I’ve copied him on this email so you  can more easily make the change.

Thanks,

Kim Davis
Information and Technology Coordinator

I created a policy to allow you to access Alcohol and Tobacco websites. When you get a chance, please reboot your Laptop and test to see if you can access the websites.

 Logged into Sophos Central and created a policy specifically for Brett Devier to allow user to access Alcohol and Tobacco websites.

Unfortunately, we do not have a way to view your inbox. When doing message traces from both Sophos and O365 all that we get is log information, nothing about the contents of the email. It also appears as though other emails are coming through to the tickets, without seeing the contents of the original email I am unable to troubleshoot as Sophos indicates it contained spam.

Thanks,
Dalton Boothe

Dalton, I don’t really understand why you can’t look at my email box on the backend and the emails that were returned to me – without having to login to my computer while I’m trying to get work done.

I wasn’t sending any attachments, only responding to your emails.

Let's see, a workaround I can think of is to try and capture a screenshot of the contents, or we can schedule a remote session. Please let me know your thoughts.

Kyle Greif – kgreif@bankdesign.net
Please set up in AD and Azure. In AD please place in same folder with same permissions and groups  as Jay Johnson. Make sure AD account syncs with Azure.

For licensing, this would be an email only account – no other Office 365 products. It would be the same kind of license as Tim Smith. Please check if we have any extra licenses we can use that were purchased through EN Computers before adding a new license.

Please send me his password, so I can set up email on his phone.

Please talk with Angela our account Rep, or myself if you have any questions.

// Case Details
Case ID: 1-343712
Customer: Bank Design & Equipment
Date: 2024-07-08 13:57:00 UTC

// Analysis:

On July 8th, 2024, MDR performed a lead-driven threat hunt on the compromised account 'cconner@bankdesign.net' due to a malicious email that was sent from the account. We have created a labs case on the zip file you have sent and will send an additional update when our labs team responds with their analysis.

We investigated the account further and observed a series of failed sign in attempts on July 8th from malicious IPs, which we have listed in the technical details section below. The user then successfully was logged into from '96.85.33.100' which has an unknown reputation on OSINT, before a second login attempt was blocked due to the user being disabled.

At this time we have the following recommendations.

// Recommendations:

- Verify if the IP '96.85.33.100' is expected in your estate
- Block the following IPs at your network perimeter
- 91.72.148.106
- 218.21.246.234
- 121.202.152.34
- 1.11.62.195
- 5.228.249.154
- 81.16.170.117
- 124.74.9.190
- 59.4.55.162
- 223.171.91.147
- 49.124.149.24
- 123.207.66.17
- 68.106.227.13
- 209.146.44.171
- 119.145.190.102

 Reached out to Ray for Assistance
 Ray created a firewall rule to block malicious IP addresses

Hi Kim I have updated the notes with what pc's are offline and what user with the last login.  Thank you!

Thanks,
Joanna Peterson

Notes
 Thank you Kim, I will put a note NOT to update OFFICE3.
 I only need to remote to see why they aren't updating all the way, it could be that the updates are downloaded and they just need to power on the pc's to finish the process.
 And thanks for the suggestion about the portal and computer vs. friendly names, thank you.

1.       OFFICE3 – must NOT be updated – it can’t be updated and should be on your list of computers to NOT update. Please make sure that is written on every document you have at PIM so you wont even try to update it.
2.       Not sure why you have to remote into the devices – I thought updates were run automatically in the background on a certain night of the week. If you let me know that schedule, I can try to have everyone leave their computer on.
3.       On the ConnectWise Remote Portal – it would be helpful to put the user name under the “Friendly Name” so we can better help you know which computer we’re talking about. AND some of the computer’s you’ve listed are not at the Main Office, they are “Remote” computers, so it would be good to change the Site to “Remote” to further help identify them.

Closed By: Andrew Blais",Discussion:,"06/10/2024 12:30 PM UTC-04/ William McCauley -  REOPEN TICKET AGAIN

They are having issues scan to email again. Had call with Xerox tech as he was onsite
 I checked through firewall logs again, i can see where there is some denied traffic going to the xerox IPs
 I checked the firewall rule > there are no xerox IPs in the rule as the one previously created was to allow traffic for gmail and no one updated me with the new IP addresses
 I had the xerox tech provide all the xerox IP address the copier would be reaching > updated the firewall rule to allow those IPs
 I asked the tech to send me wireshark reports he ran so i could see the denied traffic > being denied for TCP > looks like there are additional ports that need to be added to the FW rule > i updated the FW rule with ports and moved the firewall rule to the top of the list.
 After moving the rule up i can see traffic going through the rule now as this was not happening before.
 We tested scanning from 192.168.0.5 and confirmed it was working > tech tested again and the ""scan to cloud email"" will not open
 We tested scanning from  192.168.0.6 and ""scan to cloud email"" app will not open not will it allow you to scan
 I checked the job and when you click the ""scan to cloud email"" app it is opening the following webpage (scantocloudemailapp.services.xerox.com)
 I added this FQDN to the firewall rule under destination networks > reboot 192.168.0.5 > open scan to cloud email app > confirm i can open and scan to email (rebooted multiple times and confirmed i am able to open the app after each reboot and scan to email)
 issue seems to be resolved on 192.168.0.5
 I am still unable to get the app to open on 192.168.0.6 after updating firewall rules. I checked firewall traffic for 192.168.0.6 and there is no denied traffic
 Emailed xerox tech and Kim to let them know .5 seems to be working now without issues but .6 will not work (might be an issue with the copier itself)
 waiting response

No, we are waiting on the Xerox server to be working to download Xerox app to scan to email.
If that doesn’t work, will need to schedule a time for Jim to come onsite when you’re available for remote support to check any connectivity issues.

XEROX COPIER 192.168.0.5:
 I have been successful in sending and receiving scans from the 192.168.0.5 (main copier) using the email credentials xerox tech provided.
 I tried scanning to email 4 separate times, and each time was successful.
 However, I then changed the setting back to Gmail > reboot printer.
 After reboot I changed the settings again to the email credentials xerox tech provided > reboot printer > upon reboot I tested scanning to email and the printer will no longer send emails. Using the credentials tech provided that were working just moments before….
 Getting a message now that, “unable to connect to SMTP server. Check SMTP server name and DNS settings”
 I confirmed that the copier is hitting the firewall, and the traffic is allowed nothing is blocking from the network side
 
XEROX COPIER 192.168.0.6:
 I have been unsuccessful in sending and receiving scans from the 192.168.0.6 (2nd copier) using the email credentials xerox tech provided.
 On this printer I get a message that “unable to connect to SMTP server. Check SMTP server name and DNS settings.”
 I confirmed the settings are correct from what the tech sent me but was never able to get it to work on this copier unlike the main copier
 
I emailed the xerox tech back to see if there are any additional steps that we can take or if we need to start looking for a workaround method as I have already spent 13 hours working on this an nothing has fixed the issues.

Hi Will,
I saw that Crystal used the scanner and it worked earlier today.  I just tried to scan and I got the “job undelivered” confirmation report.
  
It shows at the bottom
“Completed with an Error (016-781) : Server Connection Error
  
Carrie V. Turner
AR Admin/HR Coordinator

_________________________________________________________________________

I asked if she can test scanning on the other copier to see if that one is working.

 B405 - scan to email is working
 C7130 - scan to email is not working

Advised Carrie that the xerox tech i am working with is out of the office today and will return monday /20... i will get with the tech monday to resolve issues

 Confirmed we can ping gmail.smtp from the DC using CMD
 I Explained what we have done previously (try creating app passwords on 2 different gmail account and still get an error when scanning to email)
 I created a new app password on bdexeroxcopier2@gmail.com the previous password was deleted > load new password onto 192.168.0.5 > reboot > test scanning > tech sees the error
 Tech checked settings > I confirmed the network settings are correct  
 Tech looked around in the printer noticed that TLS 1.3 was on > tech said that this could cause issues > test turning off TLS 1.3 > reboot printer > test scanning again > FAILED
 He performed a firmware update on 192.168.0.5 > after firmware update > test scanning again and confirmed we are able to scan to email now on the main copier
 I then had tech look at the 2nd copier 192.168.0.6 > tech states he needs to perform 2 firmware updates
 I created a new app password on the bdexeroxcopier2@gmail.com for the 2nd copier > load password > reboot copier
 Tech downloaded both firmware files > uploaded and installed the first file > confirmed complete
 Uploaded and installed the 2nd firmware update > confirm complete
 Tested scanning to email > failed
 Changed the smtp address to gmail IP
 Still having issues
 Im going to load new passwrods and then have them test scanning in the AM",,,,,Time Entries:,Member,Date,Agreement,Bill,Work Type,Work Role,Actual Hrs,,,,,,,,Total Services: 156

Ed's emails have been forwarded to Cory. I disabled Ed's windows sign-in, signed him out of all email sessions, and blocked his sign-in. Once we get Cory back into his emails, he can see emails forwarded to him from Ed recipients.

Thanks,
Javon Harper

Notes
 Asked client if the user needed their email forward to anyone and how long the account should stay active.

Asked client when they needed the account terminated by for AD and Office 365.
 Changed the email to forward to a user. Created a reminder to reach back out to the client about disabling the user email account.
 Removed the user office 365 account and pushed the ticket to Joey to update AppRiver.
 Disabled the user domain account by going to the DC > Active Directory Users and Computers> Finding the user > Right clicked the username ""Disable""
 Went into Sophos disabled the users VPN account.

 answered all questions the 3rd party had and made them feel comfortable they are not at risk and the steps we took are sufficient to prevent any further issues

 Recommended we do the following
 Ensure original recommended steps have been done, Password resets, Tokens revoked, etc.
 Check Application Consents > any newly added applications tied to exchange accounts
 Double check MFA
 Get Sophos reinstalled Office3

 Logged into O365
 Verified no additional MFA methods were added to Cory or Charlie
 Checked around in O365 for any way to view application consent

Closed By: Andrew Blais",Discussion:,"06/18/2024 10:54 AM UTC-04/ Ray Fulk -   I checked the message trace to see when this attack began, it it appears to have started at 11:35 am. The initial messages came from the IP address 104.129.24.147. That is not the external IP of the BDE office (96.85.33.100). I checked an online IP tool, which reports a hostname of 104.129.24.147.adsl.inet-telecom.org, and the ISP is QuadraNet Enterprises LLC. The tool estimates that this IP is based out of Atlanta, GA. It looks like this ISP has been used for fraud in the past: https://scamalytics.com/ip/isp/quadranet-enterprises-llc. The other, normal messages for this time period are coming from the BDE office IP.
 I checked the audit logs for this user as far back at 6/14 at midnight UTC, filtering based on the suspicious IP address, and it looks like the first sign-on from this IP was at 8:27 PM on 6/15 EDT. The details indicate they used Chrome on a MacOS device. From there, they synced the user's mailbox until 11:33 AM 6/17, when they started drafting the malicious email and began sending it at 11:35 AM. Right before that, they deleted six emails from the RSS Subscription folder in the Inbox. They sent out the malicious emails until 12:52 PM, then began moving sent items and bounceback messages to the Deleted Items folder and purging them. The last entry is at 12:57 PM, when the user tried and failed to log in, which corresponds with when Dalton blocked the sign-in.",,,,,Time Entries:,Member,Date,Agreement,Bill,Work Type,Work Role,Actual Hrs,,,,,,,,Total Services: 156

Jerry, clicked on some website in Edge and got the “Call Microsoft, there’s a problem with your computer” popup with sound and flashing. I closed Edge and click on the Sophos Scan.

Please take a look at his computer and see if something else needs to be done.

It is ok to remote into his computer. No need to call first.

Thanks,

He should be back up and running now, he could not access the server because his account was locked out of the DC, I unlocked it and we verified he could sign in using the new password. But it is still recommended that he starts using his domain account.

It appears that Cory is using the wrong account. He is using a local account tied to a personal Microsoft rather than his domain account. It is recommended that we get his data migrated over to the domain account and he begin using that one. This is why the password never synced, it was a completely different account.

Thanks,
Dalton Boothe

Cory is not able to connect to the server.
He also said that his login to the computer (his domain login) is different from his email and Microsoft login.  So I think there’s a problem from when he was added to Teams.

Cory said it’s ok to remote into his laptop if you need to.

Subject: New Email Employee Email Accounts

We need 2 new email accounts.

These are for remote Technicians, so email only – no apps. If we have any extra licenses on the EN Computers platform, you could use them.

The Email accounts need to have the same groups/permissions and distribution groups as Jeff Stires – jstires@bankdesign.net

The 2 new emails are:

John Thomas –  jthomas@bankdesign.net
Jacob Roberts –  jroberts@bankdesign.net

Angela, please talk with me about the category for these concerning billing.

Let me know when these are created, as the email address is needed to set up accounts with our vendors for training and etc.

Thanks,

Kim Davis

Closed By: Andrew Blais",Discussion:,"06/18/2024 2:15 PM UTC-04/ Kyle Newman -  Javon reached out about there Internet being down so I started to take a look at it with him to determine what the issue was.

Started at the ISP, then moved to the firewall, then to the switches. Did not identify any issues there. Saw a couple of servers where online but were unable to resolve DNS. Seems the DC is offline. Ray brought up a good point that it may be something with the VMware host.

Remoted into one of the online servers and checked on the hosts. Rebooted the DC2 VM and was able to get into it. It showed offline and I wasn't able to ping anything. After further investigation and realized that Javon had kicked off a scan of the server early this evening. That scan seemed to have picked up 5 PUAs that change the Endpoint status from Green to Yellow. I checked the firewall heartbeat rule and its set to minimum required HB to green. I changed it to yellow and the server came back online.

I updated Javon and informed him to reach out to notify the client on what the issue was and sent him a screen shot of the PUAs on the server. We should determine if they are files they require and whitelist them for future scans. I also recommended we move there DHCP service to the firewall to minimize that one server holding multiple roles.",,,,,Time Entries:,Member,Date,Agreement,Bill,Work Type,Work Role,Actual Hrs,,,,,,,,Total Services: 156

Closed By: Andrew Blais",,,,,Resolution:,"06/18/2024 2:15 PM UTC-04/ Kyle Newman -  Javon reached out about there Internet being down so I started to take a look at it with him to determine what the issue was.

Started at the ISP, then moved to the firewall, then to the switches. Did not identify any issues there. Saw a couple of servers where online but were unable to resolve DNS. Seems the DC is offline. Ray brought up a good point that it may be something with the VMware host.

Remoted into one of the online servers and checked on the hosts. Rebooted the DC2 VM and was able to get into it. It showed offline and I wasn't able to ping anything. After further investigation and realized that Javon had kicked off a scan of the server early this evening. That scan seemed to have picked up 5 PUAs that change the Endpoint status from Green to Yellow. I checked the firewall heartbeat rule and its set to minimum required HB to green. I changed it to yellow and the server came back online.

I updated Javon and informed him to reach out to notify the client on what the issue was and sent him a screen shot of the PUAs on the server. We should determine if they are files they require and whitelist them for future scans. I also recommended we move there DHCP service to the firewall to minimize that one server holding multiple roles.",Time Entries:,Member,Date,Agreement,Bill,Work Type,Work Role,Actual Hrs,,,,,,,,Total Services: 156

Subject: RE: Bank Design and Equipment - Phishing Emails -

Hi Kim,

Here is a recap of what we discussed on the phone/what was sent back from Sophos.

Sophos investigated outgoing emails from user 'cconner@bankdesign.net' and observed multiple emails with subject 'Bank Design & Equipment' sent to various users outside the domain. The email contains a URL 'rsvms[.]us/p/0e082504-4866-468e-b000-38d1032d722c' which appears to link to a website that asks users to click on a link to view an encrypted document. This activity is indicative of BEC and possible session hijacking, likely from the end user clicking on a malicious email that allowed a threat actor to hijack the session and bypass MFA to authenticate to M365. Sophos also checked inbound emails for user 'cabbey@bankdesign.net' and did not observe an email with a similar URL to the compromised account.
Sophos MDR attempted to perform a threat hunt for the user 'cconner@bankdesign.net' sending suspicious encrypted emails. However, when accessing the telemetry for M365, Sophos noticed there was no data ingested over the last 30 days. Further investigation found that the domain 'bankdesign.net' is not able to connect to the integration and does not appear to be collecting data. To provide you with the appropriate assistance for resolving your issue, Sophos opened a Sophos Support case on your behalf. We have included the Support phone number registry below and you may reference Support Case 07400224. As this case was raised at a Medium severity, please allow up to 24 hours for a Support engineer to reach out.
Below are steps Dalton performed to remediate the issue, recommended by sophos.
 Reset the compromised users' credentials
 Terminate the users' tokens within EntraID (Azure)

Notes
 Spoke with Will regarding the issue in which he informed me the Users need a AD account to add Users to the correct group and permissions
 Removed users from O365
 Remoted into DC
 Created users and added them the the correct groups
 Remoted into BDE-Sync
 Ran Sync command
 Added license to synced accounts
 Made sure users accounts mimicked Jeff  account
 No further action is needed

Javon, we had already done your preliminary steps with Will and had the server turned off.
We turned the server back on so  you could take your tools off of it. Let us know when you have removed your tools. We can then manually turn the server off. And we will repurpose the server.

This server was replaced with the New Server through EN, and except for you looking to see if there was something that EN forgot to move, your tools never really needed to be on it.

Thanks,

Kim Davis

Assuming they want to remove this server, we would first log into server via the console and shut the server down for a few days to make sure it isn't still being used for anything:

 After a few days of being offline, if nothing breaks, we can then power it back on, log back in and remove it from the domain:

 Once it has been removed from the domain, we can then shut it back down and delete the VM under Actions > Delete:

Sorry for the late response. We have not fully decommissioned the server and will need the server to stay on a little longer if you don't mind. I will reach out once this is complete so you can turn the server off.

Will, Angela,
 
Don’t know how to do it, but we need to get Rick Buehler an Office License that has TEAMS that can connect with the rest of the BDE Sales Team. Rick’s set up is similar in part to Cory’s, in that he uses a Personal O365 license on his laptop. Exception is that Rick’s laptop is a personal laptop. What you did for Cory worked. We would like you to set up Rick so he can have teams. We expect there will be a cost for the new prescription.
 
I’ve copied Rick on this email.
 
Thanks,
 
Kim Davis

Exchange Online Plan is a standalone email and calendar service only. This does not come with downloadable Microsoft apps/teams.    
Microsoft Business basic/Standard licenses include office apps like word, excel, etc.…  (standard includes downloadable apps, basic can only use apps on the web)

Sorry Will, what does the “exchange online plan 1” mean?
Does it include downloadable O365 APPs and TEAMS?

 checked the DC again > seeing three wrong password attempts and then the account got locked out
 looks like the attempts are coming from some additional saved credentials
 go to credentials manager and remove and credentials tied to kdavis or kdavis@bankdesign.net
 check local GPOs as well
 asked kim to wait and let me know if removing those additional credentials resolves the lock out issue
 kim had to leave for a meeting
 I kept researching information on this problem. Found a Microsoft tool i can use to track down where credentials are stored that are being used and failing
 will use this tool if what we did does not resolve the lock out issue, waiting on response from kim

Closed By: Andrew Blais",Discussion:,"05/03/2024 11:09 AM UTC-04/ William McCauley -  Kim's account keeps getting locked out randomly on office PC
she gets locked out sometime when trying to log into another PC or go in through an RDP session

When you check her account in AD sometimes its not locked even though it says locked on her PC

Sometimes when you check her account in AD it will show locked

From research, may want to check the windows credentials manager on her PC and remove and saved ""windows"" credentials

Check the system even log on her PC for authentication failed attempts. I could not find any on the DC

She is sometimes able to hit okay and it will let her log in after entering creds a second time. Other times it will keep her locked out.

Would be worth checking GPOs on the DC as well as local GPOs on her office PC

Notes
 Reached out to Kim
 Got transferred to Kirk
 Began looking into the issue
 Remoted into BANKDESIGN70003
 Had him test
 Got the error listed
 Pushed Office update
 Once done tested again
 Same error
 Looked at Sage Support website and tried the following
 Pushed online repair of office
 Once done tested again
 Excel opened
 Stated the user was not licensed
 Checked O365
 He had an Exchange Online Plan 1 license
 This does not grant access to the desktop apps
 Attempted to open Office 2016
 Nothing found
 It only opened the 365 versions
 Attempted to find installers
 Nothing found
 Kirk mentioned maybe it was not compatible with Office 2016
 Created Sage case 8010086754
 They informed me it was compatible
 They asked I enable all .NET Framework features and reboot
 Did this
 Tested again
 Not licensed error
 Uninstalled Office
 Searched through the DC and other user profiles to find an installer
 Nothing found
 Will stated he will double check the server
 Informing Kim we are discussing how to proceed with this issue

 Look through teams portal in O365 admin > he is added as a member and able to access teams
 Reach out to pim staff to see if anyone has seen this issue > suggested checking to see if he can access teams via web browser as there is a bug with the new teams application
 He is not able to log into the web version and gets the same message

Are you able to turn off MFA for Brett Devier for the time period of the laptop setup?
If so, I can get his password and we can set up the laptop today.

If not;  he needs to be available for Authenticating logins, then he is not available until tomorrow.

I have Marvin’s laptop with me and can turn on and connect with you to install your tools and get his VPN working, whenever you’re ready. Is sometime today possible?

To set up Brett’s computer – would you be able to turn of MFA on his profile when we install Office365 for him?

I remoted into the server and found it was full again. I was able to free up some space by deleting a snapshot for the SageBrush VM. I was then able to power it back on. I went into Veeam and disabled the backup job for now.

I updated Will and Kim via email. I will continue to monitor the server over the weekend.",,,,,Time Entries:,Member,Date,Agreement,Bill,Work Type,Work Role,Actual Hrs,,,,,,,,Total Services: 156

 Work with Kyle to resolve issues > on call with Kim
 Remote into BDE-DC2 > ESXI host is showing the main datastore is completely full and the storage on SAGEBRUSH is full
 We removed saved iso images, a powersource folder which cleared enough space to get the server back up
 Will gather information and get a quote together to add additional hard drives to the host machine
 Had call with Kim and discussed a few things. We are powering down BDE-TS to see if that causes issues, if not, we will decom the server to free up space on the datastore
 Discussed possibly moving the BDE-SYNC data to the DC as well. Would need to look more into what that would take

Closed By: Andrew Blais",Discussion:,"05/03/2024 7:41 AM UTC-04/ Kyle Newman -  After looking into this I discover the server is a VM. The issue is there datastore is full so the VM is having issues booting. I brought Will into the discussion who was talking with the client.

We where able to free up some space by delete some ISOs and a folder called PowerSource from the datastore. It gave us 1% more free space.

I recommended to Will that we need to try to free up more space by decomming any servers no longer required or consolidating a server role with another server. At the same time we need to look into how to expand there datastore capacity. I recommended to pause Veeam backups for the time being as it does use space on the datastore to perform its actions.

Will is going to take the ticket from here since we got the VM back up for the time being.",,,,,Time Entries:,Member,Date,Agreement,Bill,Work Type,Work Role,Actual Hrs,,,,,,,,Total Services: 156

 File will not open in chrome normally at work (chrome is signed in with bills Gmail account)
 File can open in chrome on home PC
 When you request access and tom approved it doesn’t do anything. Still blocks access to the file
 Shared file can be opened in incognito mode at the office
 Tested making a new profile in chrome and the shared file link opens, thinking it could be an issue with the Gmail account he is signed in with but Bill states he can open the file at home and chrome is signed in with the same account
 Tested opening the 3 files again in incognito mode and confirmed they open and changes made to the documents are saving
 Bill is going to use incognito mode to open documents for now

 Logged into her office account to see if she has downloadable products (she does not)
 Per crystal she just wants to be able to access email
 Open Mail app on the PC go to connect her work account and it allowed me to download Outlook
 We logged into outlook and the Microsoft 365 center apps on the PC and confirmed she can now access email
 not allowing her to save credentials on RDP session get a message that its not allowed. Will get with Crystal 5/2 to look at setting on her office PC

Closed By: Andrew Blais",Discussion:,"04/22/2024 2:15 PM UTC-04/ William McCauley -  After reenabling the GPO Kim was unable to connect to BDE-DC2 again
 Changed the inbound firewall rules for file/printer sharing to allow the connection instead of allow secure connection
 Ran GP update on her PC > I was then able to connect to the DC and her files (something is blocking her access when it is chosen as allow secure connection, need to look more into this or add her to the list of users for the secure connection)
 I tested clicking the finance drive that she has access to and get a message that she no longer has permission to access this folder
 Tried adding her to the permissions/share keep getting a permissions error message > I had to inherit the folder as an owner > I then stopped sharing the folder > re-share the folder and add the correct shares/permissions for access
 Go back to her PC and confirmed I was able to access the folder again

  not allowing her to connect to documents hosted on BDE-DC2
 Getting a message that there could be a group policy restricting access to printer and file sharing
 I recently created a network detective GPO that could be causing the issues > disabled the GPO and ran gpupdate on her PC > reboot
 After reboot we were able to reconnect to BDE-DC2 > I remapped the drive and confirmed we could access the documents again
 Check through the GPO I created looks like I missed giving access to Domain users > corrected the issues. Let Kim know I updated permissions would like to test
